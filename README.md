# oneMicro-PIC18F4520
I have been fan of various micro families out there. Not inclined towards one over the other. It has always been choosing right tool for the job, choosing a micro on it's specs over anything else. We at ExploreEmbedded have been working on various AVR, PIC and ARM chips for quite some time now. oneMicro is attempt to make a consistent breakout board for all of these controllers. oneMicro is designed to fit on a breadboard, with on board usb-serial with a open source bootloader. For micros that have built-in USB, usb-serial won't be needed. The pin naming will be the actual micro pins!
